      <h2>From Daily Sprouts to Full Lifestyle Meals</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      What started as a simple idea around clean sprouts quickly grew into a full-stack cloud kitchen.
      Today, we produce balanced salads, hydration options, and customizable meal subscriptions for
      professionals, families, and fitness-focused customers.
